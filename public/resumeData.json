Commercial backpack sprayers currently do not offer a \"smart\" option, making it difficult for users to keep track of product placement information. We will develop an iOS application, paired with an Arduino device inside the backpack, to meet project requirements and provide users with spray information. This application will store location, flow rate, time of coverage, and other relevant data. The purpose of our project is to simplify the lives of our client base and reduce waste caused by excess chemical coverage.",
